This is a pet project for practising some concepts of SwiftUI, following the course [100 Days of SwiftUI - Hacking with Swift.](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/loading-a-specific-kind-of-codable-data)

The images of astronauts and mission badges were all created by NASA, so under Title 17, Chapter 1, Section 105 of the US Code they are available for us to use under a public domain license.

The information that is available in `astronauts.json` & `missions.json` has been copied from Wikipedia, and it is licensed under [CC-BY-SA.](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0)
